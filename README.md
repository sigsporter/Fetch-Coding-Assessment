Greetings Fetch Code Reviewer and/or curious GitHub user!

In this repository you will find my responses to the data analyst take-home
assessment. The CSV files were read into python data frames for initial review
using VS Code and Python 3.9. The files were also loaded into a Google
BigQuery database where the SQL queries were executed. These tools were chosen
for their convenience and ease of use. I have been using VS Code and Python
for personal projects. 
In my daily work, I utilize Oracle SQL Developer to write SQL queries but have
not configured it on my personal machine so I elected to try a new tool - 
Google BigQuery.It presented a straightforward way of creating a database and 
importing csv files into database tables. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

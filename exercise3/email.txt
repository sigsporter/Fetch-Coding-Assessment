Hi [Product Leader],

My name is Stephen and I have been assigned the task of analyzing the 
user, transaction, and product data to identify trends and recommend next steps.

{1} I noticed an unexpected issue when analyzing Generation demographics by main product
cateogry. When constructing the query, the majority of the sales data could not be 
assigned to a generation. I have concluded there are 17603 User ID values in the 
Transaction table that do not appear in the user table. {4} I would like to discuss this 
more in detail with the appropriate team members to identify where there are missing
ID values. Can you help me identify the appropriate folks to analyze this issue?
I assume we would need to include members of the Identity team that designed the user
sign-up pages as well as the Financials team that designed the Transactions interface
and likely a member of the DBA team.

{2}{3} For the User data that I was able to analyze, I found that Fetch has shown a 13% 
or better growth in new users year-over-year which is certainly something to celebrate! 
{3} However, while the company is still gaining new users, the trend has been fewer total 
users and, therefore, a lower percentage growth. {4} User churn is critical for a company
like Fetch and analyzing this situation further (perhaps with better User data to identify 
other trends) will be important over the next fiscal year to ensure we maintain strong 
growth overall.

Thank you for your time, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Stephen
